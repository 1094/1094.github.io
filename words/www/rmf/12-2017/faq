<h2>ヾ(＾∇＾) What is this blog all about?</h2>

<p>Simply put: This blog is a list of Mirandy fanfiction. It started as a collection of all the fics I have read, then I opened it up for submissions. Now, I will just be listing the fics that are out there A) to beef up the <a href="http://randommirandyfics.tumbrl.com/random" target="_blank">Random Fic Pick</a>, b) to keep the blog alive since my reading has decreased <em>a lot</em>, and c) why not?</p>

<p>Text posts are fics I have not read. Submissions are tagged as such, I have not read them. The fics I have read are numbered.</p>

<p>This ride (aka the blog) started <a href="http://randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/archive" target="_blank">24 Feb 2013</a> and I'm glad it's still going.</p>

<h1>THE ASK BOX</h1>

<h3>NAME THAT FIC</h3>
<h6>Requests for naming a fic need to be sent VIA the ASK BOX. Thanks!</h6>
<p>There are two types of ‘name that fic’ asks. One is usually “here is what I remember about this fic, where can I find it?” These can be easily posted and answered by anyone who has a tumblr account (by reblogging or leaving a reply).</p>
<p>The other type of ask goes something like “hey, what are all the [fill in the bank] fics?” or “do you know any [fill in the blank] fics?” Basically, an ask looking for multi-fic answer. These will be answered with an auto-reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Hi, I am unable to assist in your fic search; however, <a herf="http://xvnot15.tumblr.com" target="_blank">XVNot15</a> has informed me she is willing to share her database of fics, her general Mirandy knowledge, as well as her time on such questions. You can send her this ask <a href="http://xvnot15.tumblr.com/ask" target="_blank">using this link</a>. Or, you can forward this question to either the <a href="https://uk.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/DWP_femslash_fanfic/Info">Yahoo! Group</a> or the <a href="http://dvlwears-prada.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal community</a>. Any of those options will be more successful than asking me. :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answered “name this fic” posts will be deleted after the fic is named and moved to <a href="http://randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/fic-named">The Named Fics</a> page. Fics that have not been named after 3 months will be deleted. I can not dictate which posts are included in tumblr’s random post generator and these posts will be moved or deleted to allow for a more enjoyable (and fic dominated) <a href="http://randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/random">Random Fic Pick</a> experience.</p>

<h3>SUBMIT A FIC</h3>

<p>When submitting a fic it is important to keep the following things in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The quote should be a sentence.</li>
    <li>Title, author, and link must be present. [If you want to be super <em>awesome</em> you can also include the number of chapters, the rating, and status.]</li>
    <li>The summary should be short, sweet, and to the point without giving away too much of the story. No more than 4 sentences please.</li>
    <li>NO REVIEWS. Just a summary. I want fics you think were great and not so great. I want every fic as long as it’s Mirandy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you send a submission, please understand it may be edited, shortened or deleted. I will send you a message asking questions and informing you of what is needed to make the submission post-able.</p>

<hr>
<h3>PROMPTS</h3>

<p>Prompts will no longer be published to the site. They will be added to the <a href="http://www.randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/prompts">Get a prompt</a> page.</p>

<hr>
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>

<p>If you send a recommendation, it will not be published to the site. It will be added to the <a href="http://randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/tumblrfaves">Get a rec page</a> in alphabetical by author.</p>

<hr>
<h3>ANON IS OFF</h3>

<p>Yes. I have <em>Anon</em> turned off. This is so I can reply to any message or submission without posting on the main page. I don’t like deleting things without letting the sender know why it’s not being posted. It would suck to have someone watching the page for something that will never show up.</p>

<h1>BROWSING THE SITE</h1>

<p>The <em>Browse</em> button at has a dropdown menu with a number of ways you can browse the fics. Using the tags on each post you can browse by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>by Author</li>
    <li>by Website</li>
        <ul>
            <li>AO3 (archiveofourown)</li>
            <li>FFn (fanfiction.net)</li>
            <li>LJ (LiveJournal)</li>
            <li>P&amp;P (Passion & Perfection)</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<p>There are some fics that where posted to other sites, but you can find them by searching <em>authors</em> or by using the URL <code>randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/tagged/[title-of-the-fic]</code> (replace spaces with dashes).</p>

<ul>
    <li>The length of the fic
        <ul>
            <li>Quick Fics (1 - 2 chapters)</li>
            <li>Medium (3 - 9 chapters)</li>
            <li>Longer (10 - 20 chapters)</li>
            <li>Novel (21 + chaperts)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Completed fics.</li>
    <li>Search by <a href="http://randommirandyfics.tumblr.com/tagged/wip">WIPs</a> is not listed solely because this theme only allows ten links to be added to the dropdown menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are set-up this way because these are the ways I usually search for something to re-read. If you have suggestions for better organizing the fics, let me know.</p>

<hr>
<h3>WHAT ABOUT…</h3>

<p>In this dropdown menu you will find almost everything else: credit for the blog’s avatart and background image, received prompts. recommendations, and named fics. You will also find a couple of links to the ask page and a link for submitting a fic.</p>

<hr>
<h3>DISQUS</h3>

<p>This feature has been removed as no one was using it.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Why make the blog?</h3>

<p>This blog gives me a way to remember what I have already read, find when I wanna read it again, and make my slight obsession with Mirandy fairly productive.</p>

<h5>|_・)</h5>

<p>There are two reasons most of the stories I have read are from ffn and ao3: 1) I can easily read both sites on my iPhone and 2) I can navigate both sites to find authors and stories I haven’t read yet. I’m human, and sometimes I just go for easy.<br/><br/>It really is <em>Random</em> Mirandy Fics.</p>
