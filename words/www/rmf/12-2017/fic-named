<hr><h4>Hi okay this is a smut fic I remember Andy found Mirandas necklace or bracelet and she went to return it. So she went to Mirandas office to return it she also didn’t want to be seen by her and for some reason Miranda came back to the office so Andy had to hide under her desk because she didn’t want to me seen by Miranda. People came into the office to have a meeting as she was sitting at her desk (Andy still under the desk) basically gave Miranda oral sex under the desk… Thank you!!</h4><p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4462691" target="_blank">Slip of the Wrist</a> by ScarlettScribble.</p>

<hr><h4>Hello, I need some help. I remember a fic where it talks about how Andy’s mother was fashionable but then when Andy got into her teens she started ‘rebelling, became more tomboy. (Dressed like she did when interviewing with Miranda) She got into fights too; there was some boy and she got into a fight with him. Her dad might’ve also taught her to play a sport. It could be that her mom died of cancer? I don’t really remember for sure though. I only remember for sure about Andy’s mom</h4><p>Thank you, lesbianlanding and gothicpheonix: <a href="http://www.ralst.com/GiftOrCurse.HTM" target="_blank">Gift or Curse</a> by blackgrl71 and <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9525081/" target="_blank">Daddy’s Little Girl</a> by jh728.</p>

<hr><h4>I’m looking for a fic where Andy pretends to be Miranda’s girlfriend when they spot Stephen out with his new girlfriend/fiance.</h4>
<hr><h4>Okay this is a long shot but I thought I would try. Does anyone know the name of the fanfic of where Miranda goes to sign some papers I think to take Irv down but the guy she is with has other plans. Andrea decides to surprise her at the ball but sees Miranda goes upstairs with that guy. Miranda does kiss the guy but feels guilty and doesn’t go any further then that. ( I have been trying to find this story everywhere I think it was named after a song not 100% sure)</h4>
<hr><h4>Hey guys, this one may be a little obscure. The story starts with Andy working for Miranda but she falls for MP early and spends a good chunk of the story trying to gently seduce her. It turns out MP has an ex-girlfriend (Eleanor (?) I want to say) who shows up to add some confusion to the mix. There is some back and forth, of course with a lovely happy ending. Towards the end the girls are in a car accident and Andy is supportive.</h4>
<hr><h4>Hi, this fanfic is one I read a while ago. Miranda comes back to the townhouse &amp; Andy is sleeping in a space bedroom (she’s meant to be there, can’t remember why) &amp; Andy’s spread out across the bed in her sleep, like a starfish. Miranda likens it to how younger people, possibly the twins, sleep &amp; wonders for an instant if her feelings are motherly in nature. Then Andrea does something &amp; Miranda feels a tug of awareness &amp; knows they’re definitely romantic. Please can you help?</h4>
