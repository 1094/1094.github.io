<p>College Senior Star Soccer Player Andrea Sachs hasn't been on her game for weeks. Frustrated, due to whatever is bothering her (you can choose), she takes her day off to practice. A ball breaks a window in the fashion building. Where Runway Editor-in-chief was visiting. The ball? Just so happened to hit the infamous Editor. Hilarity, and Angst ensue. You can fill in gaps, and decide length. :)</p>

<p>How many times can Andy say "Yes, Miranda" near to Miranda's ear before Miranda couldn't resist more? Wait! Is it on purpose?</p>

<p>Mirandy Freaky Friday style. A horrid argument leads to Mirandy having marriage trouble, and both of them thinking maybe it wasn't meant to be. A kind, though nosy, woman steps in with a little magic, and it's just enough to remind the two about the past, and the beauty of their relationship.</p>

<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andy (never worked for Miranda) owns a well known sex shop. Little did she know that she'd be knocked off her feet when a white-haired wonder comes into her shop trying to find a way to help save her marriage. As the woman continues to come, she mentions her failing less, and mentions the beautiful brunette more.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Mirandy... Labyrinth style. *cause Miranda in the Goblin King's leather? HOT!* Andrea wishes away her son to the Goblin King. Turns out? The Goblin King is a Queen, who has twin girls who take instantly to the little boy. The Queen always wanted more children before she was cursed to rule the Labyrinth. As she tricks/runs Andrea ragged she finds that maybe she has been more lonely than she thought she was. She loves the boy and finds herself falling in love with his mother.</p>

<p>Andy- drunk off her ass- grabs her phone to call her mom. Only... Miranda's name is right above 'Mom' in her contacts list. Miranda gets a lovely surprise at 1am when Andrea calls... and confesses (thinking that it is Andy's mom on the other line) that she reason she left Miranda in Paris was because she loved the woman who was her boss and couldn't deal with the heartache of knowing that Miranda could drop her just like she did to Nigel.</p>

<p>Andrea owns a fine establishment w/ licensed escorts/companions. After a client took things too far, she took herself off the 'market' & had to deal with the consequences.

<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Miranda (or Andrea) has severe Arachnophobia and things go nuts when a spider is seen. There's a lot of freedom with this one, so hope it sparks someone's interest, or several people's interest. :)</p>

<p>Miranda wakes up in a huge mansion, wondering where her daughters are. When she finally leaves the house, looking for something, anything familiar, people keep greeting her as "Madame Mayor."

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Miranda is Donna Sheridan's older sister. Sophie doesn't just invite her 'dads' to the wedding, but Miranda as well, despite not speaking to her sister in 30 years since she ran away at 20 when Donna was 10. (They both changed their name from Princhek) Andrea convinces Miranda to go (along with Cass/Caro and herself). Imagine the chaotic mess that becomes Donna's life when she runs into not only her exes, but her older sister as well. All hell breaks loose.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Semi-headcanon: Miranda wears a lot of belts, or belt-like cloths, due to her C-section scar. She sees it as her only true weakness. She wasn't strong enough to give birth to her daughters, and for the first few years after their birth she was tormented by the thoughts that because she couldn't give birth to them, she didn't deserve them, or their love. Even 11 years later, it still haunts her, and she's afraid that by not covering it up, someone will see the protrusion, and comment on it.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andrea and Miranda are arguing about baby names. Cassidy and Caroline giggle as Andrea starts teasing Miranda with the ugliest- stuffiest- names she can think of, because Miranda has shot down all of her cutesy names.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andrea has a toddler, just three years old, when she gets hired by Miranda. Nate? He’s her best friend who moved with her so that the questions that come up about her son’s father aren’t asked. While working, Andy gets a call about her son(or daughter), and has to inform Miranda in order to leave to go to the hospital where her baby is.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From Anon</h3>
<p>A fic where somehow the meaning of Miranda's and Andy's name is extremely significant. Something about a queen(Miranda) and her courtier(Andy)?</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Mirandy raising a transgender child, and stuffing the press for the saying that they're being bad parents... or something of that sort. Just lots of loving on their sweet baby, and being supportive of choices, etc.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>MAC: Cruella LOVES Halloween. EVERYTHING. Costumes, decorations, candy... but, especially the children. SHE LOVES KIDS. She hates when kids (younger, unable to 'defend', etc) are scared too much. So she makes sure that her decorating is neat and elaborate, but not horrifying (despite her personal quirks). Miranda and Andy have to hold her back while they're out trick-or-treating with C&C when a teen scares a younger kid, and the kid cries. She gets her revenge later though.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andy and/or Miranda catches one of the girls smoking/drinking/pill popping (etc). Will this next chapter in their lives be the final straw in ripping them apart? Or will they power through and become stronger?</p>

Miranda's life is thrown for a loop when her baby is in the hospital, beaten within inches of her life, and may die</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>MAC: Andrea is a popular up and coming lounge dancer, in an exclusive bar/restaurant/lounge run by a Miss Cruella De Vil. Imagine the turmoil that's brought about when she draws the attention of Fashion Queen Miranda Priestly, who wants Andrea to do modeling for her (despite her 'fat' appearance in comparison to her other models). Cruella is not a fan of sharing her prized possessions, and Andrea doesn't want Miranda to discover her secrets.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andrea is in witsec. Her 'dad' is really her witsec marshall, telling her to be careful with Runway, cause if she is made pubic & someone finds her she'll have to be relocated. What happens when she's discovered, and she walks away is to save Miranda by giving herself over to the people who are after her? Miranda, after Paris, tries to find Andrea, but can't... she doesn't exist... and after using expensive resources is contacted by authorities to not look for Andy any more.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andrea gets three onesies from her Aunt... and much to Miranda's chagrin, she and C&C won't stop wearing them, because they think it's fun, even though they are rather hideous (something they won't ever admit to Miranda) so... Miranda convinces Donatella to create a 'onesie' line, in order to get her family to stop wearing the horridly ugly ones they were gifted... and also because she feels somewhat left out... though she'd never admit it. </p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>MAC: TOTAL AU: Prison style. Miranda and Cruella are the top runners of the female prison. They're horrifying, and treat with little mercy. When a new girl comes in, they set out to teach some lessons of their grounds. What happens when the sweet, smiling Andrea (who no one will say what she's in for) proves to be just as scary as the Queens, when another inmate pushes her just a little too far. Well, the Queens may not enjoy having competition, but they love the sex.</p>

<hr />
<h3>From crazybecat</h3>
<p>Andrea has a twin sister... who gets caught up in some craziness when she visits New York and runs into two red-heads who practically drag her home to 'make up with her'... and then, while she's trying to get a word in about 'NOT HAVING A CLUE WHO YOU PEOPLE ARE' the door bell rings... and when C&C open the door? Guess who it is? Andrea. Oh... uh-oh... and guess what Andrea sees when she pushes past the girls into the den? Miranda. Kissing her sister? Oops... shit...</p>

Would love to see Andy teaching Miranda how to spit, tap dance, drink beer and sketch her in only a blue pendant!

Exact storyline need not apply, just the premise. The heartbreak of happiness being a choice. Could even be Fashion Houses of New York County.or something. Haha</p>
