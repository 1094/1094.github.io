[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93162491364/mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the-ice-in-her):    
Miranda's voice was colder than the ice in her eyes, "What do you think you are doing?"

---

[emeraldorchids](http://emeraldorchids.tumblr.com/post/93163636566/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the"):    
"Um," she paused to wipe the corner of her lips, "eating?"

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93164004841/emeraldorchids-boredrandom-mirandas-voice):    
"Yes. Yes I can see that. I'm not blind, am I," she snarled in response.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93165223699/organicallyadventurous-emeraldorchids):  
Miranda's hand was resting on her hip and her foot was seconds away from tapping against the hard floor.

---

[emeraldorchids](http://emeraldorchids.tumblr.com/post/93165388421/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
"Want some?"

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93165545499/emeraldorchids-boredrandom):  
Miranda's eyes narrowed and her lips began to purse.

---

[refreshingly-original](http://refreshingly-original.tumblr.com/post/93188528746/boredrandom-emeraldorchids-boredrandom):  
Andy held her hand out, "It's low fat."

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/93191383259/refreshingly-original-boredrandom):  
She was surprised to see the editor pause and silently waited for what would come next.

---

[refreshingly-original](http://refreshingly-original.tumblr.com/post/93195456916/justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"Very well."

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93218823691/refreshingly-original):  
Andrea managed not to let her jaw drop at the unexpected response, but shivered visibly when Miranda licked her own lips in anticipation.

---

[kitteninthesky12](http://kitteninthesky12.tumblr.com/post/93222470383/organicallyadventurous-refreshingly-original):  
Andy couldn't help the reaction her body had as those same lips wrapped themselves around a spoonful of her frozen-yogurt.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93225622866/kitteninthesky12-organicallyadventurous):  
Surely Miranda must have known she was watching with rapt attention, for there was no other excuse for the seductive show of tongue and lips dancing over the cold metal.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93225720304/organicallyadventurous-kitteninthesky12):  
And for a moment, Andy couldn't help but imagine those lips tasting that frozen treat from her fingers instead.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93359579546/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
And then Miranda had the audacity to close her eyes and let out a raspy moan.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93397770179/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
When Miranda's lips twitched around the spoon (was she hiding a smirk?) Andy felt her fingers flex.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/93532264339/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
This wasn't the first time Miranda had tried to play this game but Andrea was finding it harder and harder not to react to the editor in a way she was sure would get her fired.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93532878824/justwantedyoutoknowthat-boredrandom):  
She had to remind herself their relationship had changed (however slightly); Miranda was using her spoon after all.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93539344341/boredrandom-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
That fact, of course, had little bearing on Andrea's physiological response.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93555705889/organicallyadventurous-boredrandom):  
And as Miranda dipped that spoon in for another taste, Andy had to make a decision.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93559952406/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
After all she really should have known better than to sneak any food onto the secluded location of their latest cover shoot and she certainly should have known better than to think she could get it past the omnipresent editor of the magazine.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93776729074/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
Andy mentally shrugged and pushed her luck once again (everyone else was too busy to witness her abolishment--should it happen), "Tasty, isn't it?"

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/93782294899/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
"Mmm it's passable," Miranda shrugged but Andrea didn't miss the glint in her eye as she dove in for another scoop, "I prefer Devils Chocolate myself."

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/93797734974/justwantedyoutoknowthat-boredrandom):  
Andy almost choked on her saliva as she watched with hungry eyes glued to Miranda's lips wrapping around the spoon once again, "Miranda," she started, and took a tiny step closer- if she was going to get fired best go out with a bang, "I wan-" she was cut off by a crash from one of the tents, and Miranda shoving the spoon back at her before darting away in a flurry of anger.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/93812525031/crazybecat-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
As she watched the retreating form of the beautiful woman, Andrea realized that she should have grabbed the bull by the horns and kissed the woman after she took the first bite.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93816671509/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
Instead, she followed along, dropping the almost empty yogurt container in a near by bin, with her notepad and pen in hand.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/93862173809/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
It was almost two weeks before Andrea found herself at the mercy of the teasing editor again.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/93888763729/justwantedyoutoknowthat-boredrandom):  
This time they were stuck in traffic.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94018304841/boredrandom-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
Naturally it was Andrea's luck that the normal spacious town car was in for repairs and instead they were in a much smaller Mercedes pressed lightly against each other in the backseat.

---

[kitteninthesky12](http://kitteninthesky12.tumblr.com/post/94020822088/organicallyadventurous-boredrandom):  
Andy's traitorous brain continually noted each and every point at which their bodies touched.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94107205589/kitteninthesky12-organicallyadventurous):  
Their knees occasionally brushed... their hips, their shoulders. their elbows... she swallowed hard to try and quell her rising arousal, unsuccessfully.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94107511791/crazybecat-kitteninthesky12):  
Not that Miranda was doing anything to help with that damn smirk painted across her face as though she planned the entire situation.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94110853674/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
The smirk disappeared long enough for Miranda to spew out a list of instructions, which for some reason were animated with gestures, causing her elbow and arm to brush up against her assistant.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94114157141/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
Andrea clenched her jaw attempting to focus on the pen and paper in her trembling hand, but the editor apparently was unwilling to let her maintain any sense of professionalism as she firmly clasped a cool hand around her wrist.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94141818049/organicallyadventurous-boredrandom):  
While the teasing had been going on for some time the touching was new and Andrea tried to regulate her breathing as nimble fingers drew tiny patterns over her pulse point.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94172750924/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
"Andrea."

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94184304109/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
She squeaked, a tiny burst of air, before clearing her throat and replying hoarsely, "Y-yes, Miranda?"

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94185666754/crazybecat-boredrandom-boredrandom):  
"You may want to upgrade your hand lotion," Miranda's voice was flat and emotionless, but her eyes were full of quiet amusement.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94186011534/boredrandom-crazybecat-boredrandom):  
"I, I can't," she sputtered a moment at the loss of amusement in Miranda's eyes, and continued, "because of allergies, and sensitive skin problems..." she ducked her head, "I break out really bad."

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94186552009/crazybecat-boredrandom-crazybecat):  
With her fingers still wrapped around Andrea's wrist, Miranda pulled her purse onto her lap and began searching through it.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94187097984/boredrandom-crazybecat-boredrandom):  
"Then we will just have to fix that," Miranda pulled out a small bottle, "try this, and if you break out, then we will find another."

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94188458844/crazybecat-boredrandom-crazybecat):  
"Miranda I. I don't understand."

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94188816001/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
The editor rolled her eyes as though an idiot would know what she was referring to and gently began massaging down to Andrea's palm with her thumb.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94189968469/organicallyadventurous):  
Her face turned slightly steely, but her eyes and mouth seemed to hesitated as she glanced away and spoke, "Silly girl, I don't want rough hands handling delicate material, it would be deplorable if something was snagged..."

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94190279206/crazybecat-organicallyadventurous):  
"Oh, right," Andrea said trying to remember to breathe as Miranda began gently rubbing the lotion into both of her hands at once.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94190840849/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
"So we will find a lotion that works," she stated, her eyes not leaving her hands as she worked the cool lotion into slightly shaky palms.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94191412999/crazybecat-organicallyadventurous):  
"Ok?" Andrea breathed, still mesmerised by the white haired woman's hands moving across her own even though the lotion had been thoroughly absorbed.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94193163791/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
"You will tell me immediately if you have a reaction," the editor said pointedly in a quietly commanding voice that made the young woman's stomach clench.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94194284034/organicallyadventurous):  
Andrea's mind short circuited long enough for her to mumble, "To you or the lotion?"

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94196244364/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
If she wasn't so humiliated, she would have wondered if the look on Miranda's face was smug as the woman replied, "You will report to me, about the lotion, Andrea, really, did you smack your head on the car top when we got cut off?"

---

[orangicallyadcenturous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94204726681/crazybecat-boredrandom):  
Andrea longed to look her in the eye and say, "Yes. Yes, I did."

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94205491619/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
Taking a deep breath, she nibbled her lip for a moment to gather strength to say something brilliant, when the car rolled to a stop, and just as quickly as she could blink, Miranda had retracted herself and gotten out of the car to head back into Elias-Clarke after the preview.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94217700414/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
She didn't know when she'd ever have the chance again, but she promised herself that next time, she'd be ready.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94218339654/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
Stepping out of the car, she dashed after her speedy boss, clenching her hands tight and grimacing... oh shit... she was breaking out....

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94233871659/crazybecat-boredrandom-boredrandom):  
Her skin was burning, this was one of the worse reactions she'd had in her life and she's need to go home to fix it but she just knew that Miranda would expect her to remain at her post even when it became too painful to type, never mind carry a scalding coffee.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94245138669/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
As they stepped into the elevator Andrea started to do as she was told, "Um, Miranda, I um-" only she was cut off.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94267186706/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
"Oh my," the silky voice interrupted, "your reaction is far worse than I had been anticipating."

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94269645829/organicallyadventurous-boredrandom):  
Yes well, I did try to tell you," Andrea pouted, this was just embarrassing.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94271146216/justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"Well I think it is quite obvious we can't stay here with you in such a state, can we," Miranda asked rhetorically.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94273162429/organicallyadventurous):  
Before she finished her sentence, Miranda had her cell out and flipped open.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94273709306/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
Andrea opened and closed her mouth several times in shock; Miranda had just called her own car.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94274915404/organicallyadventurous-boredrandom):  
When the elevator reached _Runway_ Miranda hit the bottoms to close the doors and send them back down to the lobby, before calling Emily.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94292113059/boredrandom-organicallyadventurous):  
"Emily, push back the run through, I won't be in until later, and if there's a problem, tell Nigel, if he can't deal with it, then have him call me, that's all."

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94304385809/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
"Wait, what?" Andrea's voice was pure confusion.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94308695099/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
"Do keep up, Andrea, we're leaving so we can properly deal with the break out on your hands, and I am hoping that it won't spread anywhere the lotion didn't touch... it would be rather terrible if it does."

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94312832516/crazybecat-boredrandom-boredrandom):  
Before her brain was able to catch up with the sequence of events, Miranda was ushering her back into the car with rather insistent touches that Andrea would have enjoyed had she not been so focused on the discomfort in her hands.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94325520954/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
"Must you dawdle everywhere Andrea, it really is no surprise that I never get hot coffee."

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94349421024/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
Dawdling was the last thing on Andrea's mind, the burning and itching sensation had all but completely taken over and tears began to fall.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94391281504/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
Desperately trying not to bawl, Andrea opened her mouth and began to speak, "I, um cool water soak because hot water dries the skin, so cool water is best, so that it doesn't get worse, and then we pat them dry and use a soft soap and wash them and then take allergy medication... and make sure that the room is really cool too, and wrap them lightly, sometimes with a little vaseline and vinegar, so I don't scratch, and it should be okay in about eight or so hours, but-" she was interrupted by Miranda.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94582938221/crazybecat-boredrandom-boredrandom):  
"You will have to come home with me then as I promised the twins I would spend the evening with them."

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94616014569/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
"Miranda, there really is no need, if I could just go home I have everything I need there."

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94632448246/justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"I also have everything you could possibly need or I will acquire it... I won't accept any excuses about this," Miranda said firmly.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94649424599/organicallyadventurous):  
"But, Miranda, really I-" she started to speak, but was interrupted again.

---

[organicallyadventurous](http://organicallyadventurous.tumblr.com/post/94650160951/crazybecat-organicallyadventurous):  
"Andrea," she began gentler this time while stroking her face, "please let me take care of you."

---

[kitteninthesky12](http://kitteninthesky12.tumblr.com/post/94650662303/organicallyadventurous-crazybecat):  
A now very speechless Andy simply nodded and climbed into the car.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94651508034/kitteninthesky12-organicallyadventurous):  
Miranda had stroked her face... with her silky smooth hands... and said please... fucking hell, was she dreaming?

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94657582889/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
And the sound of Nigel's voice told her she was, "Really, Six, asleep at your desk?"

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94704325414/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
Jolting to attention, she gasped... then groaned... oh, that's why she'd dozed off- taking a strangled breath, she squeezed her eyes shut, "Migraine," she bit out.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94704893724/crazybecat-boredrandom-boredrandom):  
"Well look alive, she'll be back from her meeting any minute!"

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94708410189/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
Standing, Andy felt the blood rush from her face as her vision swam and her stomach churned, gagging, she grabbed for her little trashcan and promptly threw up.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94717025419/crazybecat-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"Andrea?"

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94724447724/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
Andrea was still freeing her breakfast when she felt a hand on the small of her back.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94788309984/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
Lifting her head, despite the bright lights not helping her pounding head, she found Nigel standing at her side, worry creasing his features... and Miranda... standing just inside the outer office doors, staring at her.

---

[smexipineapple](http://smexipineapple.tumblr.com/post/94791212330/crazybecat-boredrandom-boredrandom):  
Andreas eyes were quickly drawn to the live chicken sitting on Miranda's head.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94817988234/smexipineapple-crazybecat-boredrandom):  
She wiped her mouth with a napkin (maybe Nigel handed it to her?) and nudged him with her shoulder, sputtering, "Nige--Miranda--do you ... a chicken!?"

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94832666114/boredrandom-smexipineapple-crazybecat):  
"Andrea did you hit your head, what's all this nonsense about a chicken?"

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94834039094/justwantedyoutoknowthat-boredrandom):  
"Do migraines cause hallucinations?" Nigel spoke to Miranda, raising an eyebrow and tilting his head toward at Andrea.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94859326219/boredrandom-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
Miranda wrinkled her brow just slightly, "For the number of migraines I've ever had, not once have I had hallucinations... but I could easily assume that with the pain of a migraine, hallucinations could be possible."

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/94863094284/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
"Well, she's looking at you like she's seen a ghost and talking about chickens..." Nigel's voice trailed off.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94892759519/boredrandom-boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was):  
"Nige," Andrea nudged him in the ribs, trying to gesture discretely at Miranda, "why does she have a chicken... did I forget about a live poultry layout?"

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94896048089/justwantedyoutoknowthat-boredrandom):  
Giving Miranda a worried look, Nigel slowly sat Andy back down into her chair, "Six, honey, you're having a dream, why else would there be a chicken... so slowly put your head down, there, now close your eyes, before you know it, you'll be awake, and this crazy dream will be over," he pressed lightly on her head to lower it to her desk, and hoped that she would listen to him.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/94898095274/crazybecat-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"Andrea," she woke with a start, blinking the sleep from her eyes and trying to work out where she was, finding Miranda there too didn't solve the problem but at least there was no sign of the damn chicken.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/94899081354/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
"How is your head, Andrea, are you feeling any better?" Miranda asked, her face stoic though her voice was gentle.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/95005984524/crazybecat-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
She didn't answer Miranda's question instead she looked around the room, amazed by her surroundings.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/95011402044/boredrandom-crazybecat):  
Her head still felt fuzzy but she was beginning to remember how she had come to be here in what was obviously one of Miranda's guest rooms.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/95012637004/justwantedyoutoknowthat-boredrandom):  
She thought about looking at her hands, seeing how they were the root of all this, but since there wasn't any pain coming from them she brought her eyes back to the editor.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/95044635744/boredrandom-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"You really mustn't cry until you wind up passing out, it's very shocking to your body, and after you bumped your head when Patricia ran into you, I'm sure you're feeling somewhat disturbed," Miranda sat down at her side, and before Andy could concentrate, one of her precisely bandaged hands was in Miranda's grasp.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/95086539639/crazybecat-boredrandom):  
Oh god, why couldn't she remember what had happened, the last thing she remember was her hands breaking out then getting in the car and then, wait, and then...

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/95210719124/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
Miranda had let them into the townhouse, and led her up the stairs to a lavish bathroom, "The sink should be large enough to soak your hands, would you like a chair to sit down in?" She had asked.

---

[justwantedyoutoknowthat](http://justwantedyoutoknowthat.tumblr.com/post/95312813609/crazybecat-justwantedyoutoknowthat):  
"No,thank you," Andrea had gently immersed her hands in the sink that Miranda had filled for her and that was when the tears had really begun in earnest, the pain really was incredible.

---

[crazybecat](http://crazybecat.tumblr.com/post/95359835119/justwantedyoutoknowthat-crazybecat):  
"You said that you required allergy medication, would you like some Advil as well," Miranda had spoken... her voice even... as if she were politely ignoring the tears, while acknowledging the evident pain.

---

[boredrandom](http://boredrandom.tumblr.com/post/95370998309/boredrandom-mirandas-voice-was-colder-than-the):  
Andrea bit her bottom lip and sniffed, all in an attempt to not cry out in pain, as she nodded her reply and stuck her hands even deeper into the basin.

"All right, I’ll return shortly with Claritin, and Advil, scream if my daughters decide to bother you, but you’re not here for work, so they shouldn’t play any pranks."

Miranda was a second from exiting the rom when Andrea spoke again, "Um, Miranda," she paused waiting to meet the editor's eyes, "maybe a chair would good idea."

Miranda had given the faintest of smiles, before disappearing briefly and returning with a comfortable stool chair- that was the perfect height to still keep her hands in the water--and then she’d left again to get the medication... and that’s when the trouble had started.

The pain was worse than she could ever remember it being and it was impossible to keep the tears from falling as she forced herself to keep her hands under the water in spite of the discomfort.

When Miranda had returned, things had grown mildly uncomfortable upon discovering that Andy would be unable to take the pills by herself, giving way to Miranda popping them passed plump lips into Andy’s mouth, before holding a glass for her to drink from.

As Miranda released the pill into Andrea's mouth, her fingertips blushed against the younger woman's lips, pulling a soft gasp from Andrea and causing her to momentary forget how to swallow.

Choking, Andy had pulled her hands from the water and stepped backwards, unaware that Patricia had come in to lap at her water dish, which caused the startled mass of dog to jump and knock her off balance.

Andrea heard a soft sigh as she tried to regain her balance; the sound was followed by a hand on her forearm and one on her lower back.

Andy was a bit surprised to feel her bosses confident hands on her. At that moment, all Andrea could think about is how close she was to her--she could smell her expensive perfume--and how much she wanted to get closer.

"T-thank you” stuttered Andrea as Miranda helped her stand up straight.

"You really must learn to stay balanced, Andrea.” Miranda’s eyes were full of mirth and her smirk was faint. She was waiting if Andrea would put more distance between them, or if she even wanted to.
