Me: I can handle that.
Royal: Cook over medium heat - 
Me: Okay.
Royal: - stirring constantly until mixture comes to a full bubbling boil.
Me: What? How am I supposed to know it's at a full bubbling boil if I am constantly stirring it?
Royal: Then remove from heat.  Pudding will thicken as it cools.
Me: ... 
Me: That didn't answer my question.
Me: ... (five minutes later)  Okay, so that shit should say, "Stirring until you feel the pudding thicken."
