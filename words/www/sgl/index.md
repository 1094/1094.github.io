## Words as Poetry
#### [... something got lost](#.html)  
A collection of poetry I have written and rewritten over the years; this is most likely the closest to 'complete' it shall ever be.  

#### [... thoughts of others](#.html)  
The poems that I enjoy that didn't make _... something go lost_ canon.  

#### [... the sounds of thought](#.html)  
A few spoken pieces, most of which are featured elsewhere; however, I like the way I sound reading them enough to give them their own space.

#### [... the look of daydreaming](#.html)  
These are my poems as images, as extremely short films, and as the thousands words on a picture can speak.
