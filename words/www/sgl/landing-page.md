This site is to a recreation/revision of the first website I ever created: _[World of Words (WWords)][1]_. The site was created many, _many_, years ago and was my way of learning and practitice HTML and was written entirely with inline HTML. (I had no idea CSS was a thing--and, quite frankly, I'm not sure CSS was a thing when WWords was created.) I have maintained an archived copy of the [site][1], thanks to the loveliness that is _Dropbox's_ Pubilic Folder.

As _[WWords][1]_ was creating as a way to teach myself a websign language, so will _Something Got Lost_. I am learning the ways of _Markdown_ in hopes of improving my journaling and writing practices and the lost of an hard-drive has encouraged me to revise and reorganize a great deal of my work. In process of doing this, I have found a number of pieces I throughly enjoy; that I would like to share. I also finding myself wanting more permiment solutions for the storage of my work--and you know what they say 'once it's online, it's always online.' As a result, this tumblr account was created and will act as 

#### a basic portfolio of my creativity.

If you decide to explore the site you will find a number of things I describe as _art_; such as poetry, fanfiction, and photography.

However, this portfolio is not yet ready. Feel free to check out [WWords][1]--be warned, my color choices at the time where less that stellar at the time--and you'll get a small taste of what is to come.
