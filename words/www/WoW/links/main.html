<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">What is the World of Words? Good Question.The World of Words is made up mostly of letters. *Smile.* And they come together to make a collection of short stories, poetry, and made-up language, even art and photos. This is not all the work I have done, but it is what I consider some of my best; a ride into the mind of Dia (a.k.a. TerriRain) which is filled with vampires, lovers, bad break-ups, and nightmares. <br><br>Are you willing to go on this ride? Click on one of the links below to start the ride.</blockquote>
