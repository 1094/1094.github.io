<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">ants live such simple lives,
<br>gather food, eat, work, do they sleep?
<br>do they feel the pain when their brother is stepped on?
<br>or fried with a piece of glass?
<br>do they shed a tear for the millions lost at war?
<br>	
<br>in and out of their hill
<br>what are they working on?
<br>they scrabble past one and another
<br>but do they stop and speak?
<br>share the joys and pains of another year past?
<br>how many make it to a year?
<br>	
<br>do they march in rows and dig holes for those past?
<br>or water the battleground where the bodies lay?
<br>	
<br>would they laugh at us humans, morning for more?
<br>one more day, one more goodbye?
<br>one last hug or smile?
<br>	
<br>are they stronger for their ignorance?
<br>happier in their bliss?
<br>	
<br>bred by the millions is one really missed?
<br>can they really tell the difference when bob doesn't show up?
<br>do their hearts bleed, or mothers scream?
<br>	
<br>some things we were never meant to know
<br>people come, then they go
<br>but being forgotten like ant #12
<br>that would be the only real lost
<br>	
<br><i>rest in peace juan</i>
