<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">This is how it all started, there was poetry before there was writing systems.  And in my opinion, hearing the writer read their work is the best way to go.  Too bad I am only posting four.  But if I get some time, I'll add to it.<br> Two of the poems below are also in the <a href="poetry.html">Poetry</a> section.  Read them to yourself first, then come back and listen to my reading.  That difference only makes the poem cooler. . . all great things have more than one reading.</font></blockquote>
