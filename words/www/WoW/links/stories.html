<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">
I have always wanted to write a book, and I have quite a few "starts." I call the following "short stories" but I am not sure if they really are.  They are really short tales, they could be called "clips" as well as stories.  Sometimes, I look at them and wonder if they are just poems that are missing a few line breaks.  Either way, people are always asking for the "next chapter." Too bad I don't have the attention span for it.</font></blockquote>
