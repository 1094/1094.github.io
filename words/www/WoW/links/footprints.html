<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">I once had a dream,
<br>very similar to that
<br>which we thought was anonymous.
<br>Along the beach
<br>I found countless prints,
<br>overlapping with events
<br>from my life, they took
<br>one of two forms;
<br>that of a laid out body
<br>and that of feet.
<br>Mostly, it was just
<br>feet, but twice, when I hit
<br>rock bottom, I saw the
<br>laid out body, no bigger
<br>or smaller than me now.
<br>I knew what the one
<br>shaped like feet meant,
<br>I read the poem, when I saw
<br>two sets, He was walking with me, 
<br>one set, He was carrying me.
<br>I looked around, maybe He could help,
<br>being all knowledgeable and 
<br>everything.  Then there was 
<br>that feeling I wasnâ€™t alone.
<br><i>Yes, child, what must you know?</i>
<br>"These prints, the big ones,
<br>shaped like my body,
<br>why?"
<br><br><i>Um, I guess I must have dropped you.</i></font></blockquote>
