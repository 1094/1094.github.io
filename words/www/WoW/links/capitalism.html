<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">Fearful, she held her hands over her naked breast
<br>aware of the sounds around her, but lost to their meaning.
<br>Thousands of people with pale skin stood below her stage,
<br>taking turns raising their hands, nodding their heads, and smiling,
<br>strange twisted smiles, with secret stuff behind them.
<br>Cold, confused, where were her children, her husband?
<br>A few men walked on the stage beside her, circling like vultures.
<br>What did they want?  Their lips moved as they grinned,
<br>as they took her arms, legs, and breasts into their hands,
<br>pulling flexing, squeezing --
<br>	
<br><i>The wench yelled something
<br>tainted and loud, or they thought it was foul, so they
<br>began the training, quick and without mercy.
<br>Three days later she awoke in a room not so  much
<br>unlike the one on the boat, to a language she understood.
<br>It's been weeks that felt like years, her ears drank of that water
<br>"Be still.  Later I'll teach you the rules."  So she lay still
<br>as stones in cold water.</i>
<br>
<br>-- Her eyes grew big, and she tried
<br>to pull away, one are raised, quick to smack her,
<br>"No hitting the merchandise until you've paid."
<br>What are they saying?  What language is this?
<br>BANG, a man with a hammer slams it down
<br>and a big pale man came and took her away by the chain
<br>hanging off her neck, linking her arms with her legs.</font></blockquote>
