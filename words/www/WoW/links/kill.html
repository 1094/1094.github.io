<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">It was my frist kill and the amount of blood scared me. The way it slide from her to me as if there was a traffic controller saying, "faster," "you thru the left hole and you thru the right." All the while she ran five fingers thru my hair and her other hand moved slowly, gently, over my back.  Honey still dripped from her body but my hand had ceased to perform it's magic.  For her, this death was more like that which Shakespeare spoke of; only that meaning of the word raced in her mind (I could hear it loud and clear) but I knew both would visit her tonight.  I wanted to stop there, with the orgasm, but the thirst took over and there was nothing for me to do but enjoy it. She arched her body into mine and I slowed my meal, I wanted it to last.  
<br>Moans of pleasure slipped from her lips and danced into my ears.  "More, please . . . . . . more."  My fingers went back to work and the dance began again.  We rocked together as if her bed was made of water. I felt her body tense, relax, tense again. I felt my hand become wetter and wetter. "How much blood does the human body hold?" Still I drank, still she moaned, still we rocked, and then we began to float, slowly lifting off the bed.  My back landed on the ceiling as she climaxed and the well ran dry.  We drifted back to the bed as swallowed the last of her blood and I released her.
<br><br>As I climbed out her sixth floor window I thought, "This ain't gonna be that bad of a life after all." </font></blockquote>
