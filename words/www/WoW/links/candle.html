<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">The parcel arrived this morning and I was ready to open it, to tear the postal tape away, but your name stopped me. I froze.  I grabbed it and a football quarterback ran through my mind, tossing your package across the field.  I lifted it, but couldn't bring myself to throw it.  
<br><br>
Instead I sat it down and remembered our friendship, it was like a feast.  We ate, greedily, forgetting to savour the taste and conversation.  Like all good things, the meal, the friendship, the comfort of love, all over.  There was no memorial, no ceremony, no mourning.  What happened to us?  You couldn't even drop off the package yourself.  
<br><br>
Almost twelve hours later I opened the box, ignoring (or at least tried to ignore) your hand writing, your memory.  A candle. I'll light it in hopes that the smoke will bring comfort.  
<br><br>
I watched the smoke dance with the air and light then disappear. Our lives are that fleeting, here one second; the next we are nowhere to be found. But the aroma has suffocated my hopes, the smell of roses, too overpowering to bring pleasure.  
<br><br>
But I lit the candle, watched it's twinkle, and remembered that I miss you.
<br><br>
Then I put it out.</font></blockquote>
