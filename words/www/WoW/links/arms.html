<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">two days ago we kissed, i can't remember what happened, not all of it, but i remember her leaning in, my heart stopping, our lips touching, and me thinking, <i>wow, folks were not bullshitting about the fireworks.</i><br><br>
last night she invited me to sleep with her.  said we have came so close, so many times, that she wants to experience it with my arms around her. "no funny business" was my reply, although my brain was going crazy, i would be sleeping in someone else's bed, someone else's space, but with my arms around the most beautiful girl in the world.  she laughed and beckoned me to the bed.<br><br>
we laid there for a while, just looking at each other, but she was tired, and comfortable, and sleep easily. i was not expecting to fall asleep.  i thought i'd be up all night playing in her hair.  and i was up, for about 3 hours watching her breath, watching her eyes blink, watching smiles slide on and off her lips, counting the number of eye lashes (78) on her right eye. but sometime during the left, i lost count, and dazed off.<br><br>
and i awoke, still holding her in my arms, but now she was watching me, smiling as i understood what that meant, and again, she leaned in. "morning breathe" my nervous lips let it escape before my brain could process it. she didn't seem to care, but she pecked instead of kissed. but the sweetness evolved & morning breathe was pushed aside because we couldn't taste it.<br><br>
our hands moved slowly across bodies as our lips and tongues played, native joy was taking over her mind, but i understood. i broke the  pleasure of touching and asked, "how far do you want this to go?" knowing it's only been hours since that first kiss, her answer, "stop thinking." a peck. "as far as it wants to go . . " <br><br>a kiss, a touch, the arch in her back, <br><br>
and that's how it began.</font></blockquote>
