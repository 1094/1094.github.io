<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">I have been writing poetry for 15 years (seems like a long time, don't it?) and I have over 100 poems, that does not include the many lost (don't write on napkins).I can't imagine living without it, it is the air that flows within me and the blood that keeps my heart pumping.  I know it sounds corny (and it'll sound worst if you don't like my work) but it does,  slowly and with small steps, keeps me moving through life. It is my oldest and strongest passion.  One day I hope to teach summer poetry workshop at some college, somewhere.<br>Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.</font></blockquote>
