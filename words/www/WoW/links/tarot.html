<br><blockquote><font size="2" color="green" face="Arial Narrow">So I have been trying to learn how to read tarot cards for a while; I think it's really cool, the whole idea of Tarot.  One day, while trying to study the meaning of the cards, I came across this website that had loads of Tarot cards images.  So I grabbed a copy and added a few lines of poetry. The first four images posted here are all from the same deck, The Witch's Tarot (I believe). I can't remember where the other three are from.<br>A picture is worth a thousand words, but can always narrow it down.</font></blockquote>
