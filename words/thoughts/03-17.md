I want to write something, but I don't really know what.
Sigh.
Which is pretty much my everyday.
I should try to figure out how to revive something.

So. DJ is standing on the roof, looking almost blank like in the sky that just sucked away the wicked witch. She was trying to figure out if the witch could come back, if she could trick more kids and start this all over again, but she couldn't figure out where the witch might have ended up. It's not like they 'sealed' her into a cave off the woods. They banished her out of the zone. Completely. Right?

Lavender suggested she and Ahomo go find Tin Man and Glitch, but before that, she wanted to know where they were going to go. She correctly guessed Az wouldn't be too happy staying here. Az didn't actually reply. Instead she reminded DJ that they were still holding hands with a light squeeze. DJ turned to her and asked if the Northern Castle would be be okay, slightly confused by the question since she had no idea where else they could go. Az's answer was just a breif nod.

After their parents disappeared back into the tower Az spoke, slowly and oddly quietly. "I know there's some really ... unpleasant memories there, for you more than me, but I can't think of anywhere else to go. Plus, we can fix it up."

DJ could only nod. She still didn't understand of this magic shit worked and she was pretty sure it was going to be more Az than her.
