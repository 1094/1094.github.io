Okay, so I was supposed to be working on the video-log story, or _The Wake Up Call_, but instead, I think Ima work on a _A Thief for Christmas_.
Cuz why not?

So what I need to do is:

1. Finish the notes.md. I was putting the story in order of happen. Just copy and paste into the timeline. I was putting the story in order of happen. Just copy and paste into the timeline.

2. Once that is done, go back and read again, fix whatever typos I can find.

3. Fill it out. Add bits that need to be added. That make the story make sense. Also add bits about Andy drawing, maybe.

4. Work on part 2. Does that really happen? Do I have the words for it?
