The problem was that Moana wanted to kiss her.

Moana had heard the stories, there were quite a few, about that kind of kinship. Love. It always sounds so easy. Like, everyone just _knew_ that they had meet _that_ person. Some times that knowledge hit sooner than later and some times it took years, but the people involved always _knew_. Moana had vaguely seen the process; had watched two of her older friends fall in love. She had seen how they expressed it; the holding of hands, the small touches to arms and shoulders and legs; the way it seemed impossible for them to look at anyone but each other. She saw the same things with her parents, but their gestures were more intimate, they lasted longer, the movements were different, almost more intense. Moana remembers seeing her parents kiss, she remembers what it felt like to see it. They weren't lost long, tongue-filled kisses, not usually, usually it was just them touching each other with their lips, but there was something in the movement, a hidden part of the action that made Moana want to experience the same thing.
