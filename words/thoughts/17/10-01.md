I wish this computer had enough CPU and RAM to be my main machine, but it doesn't. Although, considering I figured out how to change the CD=ROM to a HHD and how to swap out the RAM on my MacBook, I'm pretty sure I could find something online detailing how to change the RAM (if not the CPU, as well) for this iMac, since it at least runs 64. I don't think I'll to swap the hard drive on this tho, because Linux plays well with exturnal drives and I can easily add space from the 1TB drive to this home folder. 
Speaking of the 1TB drive, I need to reformat that. And if I make three partitions I can dd each computer to it for backup.
I just finished putting Ubuntu back on the iBook. I don't like Ubuntu, lol, but I have no choice cuz it's the only Linux still 'supporting' and allowing downloads of their OS for PPC.
And I'm just gonna run the iBook from the command line, no gui, desktop, or window manager. That's pretty much the only way it'll keep any speed. 
Really, I wonder if I could hook all three computers up to the same `/home` folder. That would make a great deal of this much easier.
