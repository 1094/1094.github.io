I am not sure I'll ever actually write anything, but I have this vim set up and ready, and truly this is a better way to to write. There are no menu bars or distractions. Sadly enough there is no spell checker either, but really, this is just a place to write. The editing can be done somewhere else.

Speaking of editing, I complete forgot I'm supposed to be editing taht fic for Joy. I'll have to play with it tomorrow. Right now, I'm going to eat something and get ready for bed. I should take a shower before I lay down...

And I just remembered this ~/txt/daily/ folder is supposed to be for stories. Not my rabbling thoughts.
