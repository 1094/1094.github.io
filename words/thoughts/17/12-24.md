When Andy first quit woriking at _Runway_ she and Nate had decided they would keep seeing each other. Well, I say they decided, but really, Nate smiled that goofy, charming smile he Andy had a hard time saying 'no' to and asked if they could work something out, if they could try, and Andy, with no good reason to say 'no' (just because it didn't feel right anymore wasn't a good enough reason, even her favorite pair of jeans fit funny when they first come out of the wash, maybe she just needed to 'wear' this a bit before it 'fit' agian) had agreed. So, when he left for Boston they had plans for a phone visit and tentative plans for a visit (if their new schedules allowed for it).
Nate was excited. Despite everything that had happened between them he was still in love with Andy and he was hoping he'd have the chance to make up for his assholish behavior. Part of him knew he didn't deserve another chance, but you know bout not looking horses in the mouth and such. He was so excited and skipping so much of the looking that it took him two weeks to realize something wasn't right and once he noticed he knew it wasn't something he could explain, it was more of a feeling, not so much a thought, so he didn't really know how bring up to Andy.
