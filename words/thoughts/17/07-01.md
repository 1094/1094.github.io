Miranda can't find the laptop at _Runway_. If she does, then Andrea can't add the entries from Paris (and that most def needs to be part of it)... And plus, she'll need her computer for work... right?

So, if the story starts with the lecture hall. Then goes straight to Paris. It starts ....

Miranda wasn't entirely sure what she was doing, but Andrea had been gone for over six hours and Miranda was sure the girl was half way back to New York. Or at least the airport waiting for the next flight away from France. Miranda swiped the keycard and watched the small light blink yellow before turning to a steady green. She could feel how empty the room was before she entered it.

Andrea had left.

But she had left everything that belonged to _Runway_. Everything was neatly stacked and labeled in the front room, the first thing you'd see when entering. Miranda made a mental note to inform Nigel that someone would need to come and pick these things up. It wasn't that much. There was a suitcase (borrowed from the Closet) with a note stating it contained clothing borrowed from the Closet as well. Her assigned cell phone and laptop sitting on top of it.
