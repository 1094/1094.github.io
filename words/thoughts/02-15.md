So. The goal right now is to get everything backed up propertly and back onto the 1TB drive.
Or at least that was the plan.

I think right now, the best idea might be to hold off on making tars to go on the 1TB drive. instead. I think i'll actually go through and sort all this shit so that all the `hhd/*` gets boiled down to two folders: `writer` and `3953`. Then I can put all the `3953` on the acer (all the shit, music, images (including pic-poems), pdfs, cleaned up box drive (maybe add the onedrive to it). and then just the text files will be here on `writer`. 

I also have to remember to rename all the text files to `md`.  


oh, and so you don't forget:
# backup and tar
tar cvpzf name.tar.gz --one-file-system /home/sir
# unzip and restore
tar xzvf name.tar.gz
