Andy didn't know what to do with the unidentifiable emotions flowing from Miranda's side of the car. hell, she didn't know what to do with the emotions flowing from herself, but at least the were nameable. she felt like an coward and a waste because last night she could not bring herself to close the gap and hold Miranda's hand, to offer that kind of comfort outside of a car. and, to top it off, she allowed Miranda to blow her off, like it had never been offered or accepted before. and even worst, she couldn't bring herself to do it now, like she forfeited the right when she didn't offer it in response to Miranda's tears. adding to the waste of place feeling was how she learned of Irv's quote, unquote take-over, and the way Miranda looked at her when she tried to warn her. the first time was type of dislike and annoyance Andy hadn't seen since the blue lecture. 
    
and this ride was beginning to feel suffocating. Andy's emotions were not jiving well with Miranda's... well, Miranda's quietness? not like quiet as in not talking, Miranda talks as little as possible. but this was like extra quiet. and distant. and decidedly not pleased but not really angry either. just trying to define it, so maybe she could do something about it, was tiring Andy out.
