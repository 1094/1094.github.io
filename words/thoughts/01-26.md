# Testing.

I want to see how this _vim-pandoc-syntax_ thing works. I __don't__ why it's highlighted the words pandoc and syntax. Oh. That much be some type of spell check.

# Back

So, I changed the misspelled word syntax. Now it's underlined and red (cterm=196) and I will be changing that because it hurts my eyes, lol. 
Also, it appears that _pandoc_ does folding at headers. Shrug. Not sure how I feel about that. But I do like the highlighting of trailing white space, but Ima wanna change that color, too.
Alright, 166 isn't the color I wanted for misspelled words (I think Ima need to install another plugin for that) but it's way better than 196 and more readable than 166.

# Highlighting vs terms 

Another decent question: Will this look the same in xfce4-terminal, where I have a different color scheme set?

Nope. Looks to be the same colors. I wonder if that means pandoc/hi just overwrites everything else. 

Ima add that other plugin now, because, really, I want misspelled words to be a type of blue.

# Nice

So, I am liking the highlight color for the misspelled words. I can not seem to change the color of the trailing white space but I'll worry about that later. 

Cuz, really, _this_ and __this__ and ___this___ was all I really wanted. I might check later for underlines but that's not something I usually use in my writing, which is why I set it for misspelled words.
