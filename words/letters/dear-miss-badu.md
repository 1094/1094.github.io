# Dear Miss Badu `MySpace Message`

Hi Miss Badu

WOW! I just joined MySpace about a week ago. I search your name, not really thinking that you would be on here. I can't believe that you are.

I know you must hear this all the time, but you are my favorite artist. And I mean artist in every sense of the word. I have seen photos of you, and I was at the Frustrated Artist Tour (Pittsburgh, PA Club Laga) and even your clothes can count as art. Your music is not just sounds and words, but more like poetry being born out of rhythm.

... & On, asks what good does your words do if they can't understand you, but listening to your music I have learned that understanding counts, but so does feeling.

I still remember the first taste of your music I got. It was _Baduizm Live_. My friend had a tape of it in her car, and I fell in love with it from the second it started. Thankfully, she was not feeling it and gave me the tape. I played that tape so much the sound disappeared. I now own _Baduizm_, _Baduizm Live_, _Mama's Gum_, and _Worldwide Underground_.

Listening to you grow as an artist has only made me want to grow as a writer. I have written many a poem with your sounds playing in the background.

I think that "Don't Cha Know" will now and forever have a special place in my heart. It has helped me thru so much stuff.

I don't know if you ever thought about this, like before you started making albums, how much your music can, would, and will influence the people that listen, but song that comes from you, even "Green Eyes" feels as if it was born out of a spiritual and positive space. 

I just want to thank you for sharing part of yourself with me. 

Wow. I feel like a dream just came true. 

THANK YOU
