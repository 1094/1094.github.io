Dear Beth
written 05.08.06

As much as I try to hate you, it just doesn't happen. You are burned into my heart, your voice I could listen to forever while tracking the movements of your eyes, and you, you just don't care. And I am tired. I know you don't care and I wish I didn't either. But, sadly, thats not the case. You have been burned in my heart. As much as I want to kiss you, bitch, I want to slap you. Sorry, I only partly meant that "bitch." But I can't even look at you without wanting both.  You have some strange ass idea in your head of what your love should be, what he should look like, what type of job he could have, and blah, blah, blah. But my mind is fucked, why? Because I know whoever he is, whatever he does, he will not be able to make you as happy as me. Nor would he love you the way I do. You know what? I don't even care if you settle down and find yourself a her, nobody is gonna do it for you the way I can, the way I want to, the way you should let me.

Yeah, I fuck with you a lot. Like that kid in the second grade did, and do you know why? It's because I am frustrated. I trying not to like you.  And somewhere in my brain popped up an idea: If you treat this girl like you don't like her, then you won't.  I should have known it was bad idea. The same thing happened when I was trying to be straight. I had the idea that if I just have sex with a bunch of guys (really it was like 10) and date only guys and make myself think about only guys "in that way," then my feelings for women will just go away.  And you know what? It didn't work then and it isn't going to work now.

I am in love with you. I spent a lot of time fighting with myself. Trying to tell myself that it wasn't love.  The only way to prove that I am not in love with you is to define what I think love is and compare it to how I feel about you. And I did that.\

love is . . . 
love is nothing
but another word for
want

i love you

And guess what? When I was writing that poem I was thinking of nothing but the lies we see on TV, in movies, hear in music, and etc. I wasn't even paying much attention to the words I was writing. But when I got done and read it; I learned two things. One, love is nothing but a want.  Think of someone you honestly love. Now tell me love is not a bunch of wants.  Second, this poem is my feelings for you, more or less.  Mainly, I want you to be happy. Honestly and truly fucking happy. At the same time, I want to be the person that makes you happy. But if I can't have both I'll be happy if you are.  \
\
Grated, with that said. I feel like I am dying inside. I look at you and you look and sound happy. And I can't even be your friend. \
\
I still can't believe I spent all summer waiting for you to IM me. Meeting you at that lip signing thing let me know one thing: love at first sight does happen. \
