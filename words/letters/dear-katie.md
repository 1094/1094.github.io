# Dear Katie
## Letter One

Rest In Peace, Lady
It's so strange. My brain knows you are gone, and seeing you that box will only make my brain more aware. But, to be honest, my heart doesn't believe it. How can you be gone? You are my number 2 - I have known you longer than any other friend I have ever had. You are the only person who knows everything about me. Shit, you know more about me than Brittney does. Who am I supposed to talk to about her now? No one else has your awesome sense of humor, or Ammaazzzing qualities. And while we only hang out every two or three weeks, those times are important and special to me. And in a week or so, when all this is done, I'm gonna wanna tell you something, and it'll hit me like a ton of bricks - you aren't here anymore.

And is it wrong? But part of me, a big part of me, is happy. Your RA is no longer a problem. Stupid doctors no longer matter. Pills that will make you sick, make you someone else, no longer have to be taken. Headaches that make your eyes water and talking impossible, will no longer fuck with you. You aren't gonna have another blackout or period of confusion. You will forever more be you, without any meds taking you away and leaving an empty shell. I will miss you more than I can even realize at this moment, but knowing you are in a place where no pain can touch you and no problem can stress you, makes it all that much easier to deal with. All that much easier to accept. And as much as I don't want to see you in that box, I know I have to go, I have to say good-bye, I have to have that closure. Brittney is gonna come with me, because I'll need her holding my hand.

The hardest part of all this for me is Kris. I know you wanted us to be friends, but I also know, you know how hard it is for me to make friends, so I know you are mad. But I am sad, she has lost her wife. You are gone. And everyday she is going to have to deal with that and there is nothing I can do to help or ease her pain. Shit, I don't know how to be there for someone like that. But, if there is a God, give Kris the support she needs right now. Somehow, make this time easier, faster, for her. And give her the strength to keep going. 

Katie, I love you.

Yesterday, me and Brittney were talking about what my wedding would look like, she wanted to line up my family and hit them (for not telling about the birthday party they were having for my Grandma) and then hide. And I replied, How you gonna hide? How many white folk you think gonna be at my wedding, Katie's dead, so that's one less. And in that moment it hit me. You won't be a bride's maid at my wedding ... I know you'll be there, but not as a bride's maid. 

I don't know how I am going to deal with this. It's gonna be day by day, and I am going to try my best to put aside my selfish desire to have you here and remember that you are you, that you are free, and that you do not hurt any more. 

I will love you always.
And you will be here, through the people who know and love you.

## Letter Three

So, I know this is gonna be a real one-sided conversation, but, I guess we need to have it. 

Although, now that I have talked to Mrs Kym, I'm not really sure where to start. 

Well, here we go: I miss you. I wish you were still here. I hate that I didn't realize you were my best friend until it was too late. Meaning, I didn't have a chance to tell you something you already knew. :) Yeah, cuz you are just that Amazing. 

At some point I am gonna hafta add to this. 

And the rest came the next day - & i posted it on tumblr. (11 May 2012)

calmness is a rarity for me. a quiet mind, having one thought at a time, and having the focus to deal with that thought, right then, when i have it (& not two weeks later) does not happen often. maybe once a month, once every two months. and so when it does happen, it causes some anxiety, confusion.

so, confused and nervous is how i spent most of yesterday. the calmness was so overwhelming that, for almost an hour, i couldn’t figure out if i was calm or depressed.

but because i could focus, follow with the string of confusion, i was led to insight.

i was, indeed, deeply sad and hurt. but the only reason i was able to understand that was because i could follow the thought long enough to experience the emotion (something else that is extremely rare for me). which led to the post of me stating ‘i wish i could cry.’. (but my inability to cry will be dealt with later, i need to finish these thoughts).

a year ago this saturday (12 may) my best friend died. at 30 years old, for reasons i have yet to be told. that morning her wife woke up to find her, in bed, next to her, dead with blood coming out of her eyes & ears; however that is not the point.

the point is that, for maybe the third time in my life, i was able a thought long enough to find the emotion attached to it.

i am sad because my best friend is dead. i will never be able to see her again. or share our sick sense of humor (she was the only one who laughed at ALL my jokes, and never gave me that what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-you face). i regret the fact i never said to her “you are my best friend and i love you.”. it doesn’t matter theres a pretty good chance she knew it; she never heard me say it. i regret not spending more time with her.

i feel some type of way because i want to be angry about the fact she is gone; but honestly i’m happy. she doesn’t have to hurt all day every day (she had RA). i’m happy she no long has to live the with memories of a fucked up life or abusive boyfriends. she’ll never feel the need to cut again. she’ll never have another migraine or figure out what to do with her dumb ass doctors or pills that don’t work.

she is in a better place, i just wish she could visit this one long enough for me to give her one last hug.

& because this is the longest period of clarity i can remember (a whole two days) i am able to follow this string of thought even as i type this: i’m mad at myself and feel like an awful person because i don’t want to be friends with her wife. we weren’t friends while she was alive & i don’t think i like her enough to be friends now. but i understand. her wife was number one in her world and i was number two. through me her wife can keep some of that connection alive. so, i try to be a good person. i check in with her & sometimes we go for walks. i hope thats enough. she knows her wife & i are a little antisocial, it was one of the things thy brought us together. and i think she respects that. i need to be grateful for that and stop feeling bad about it.

& with that, i am gonna stop typing. thanks for taking this ride with me. but the string is not done. i always deal with the logic, the words, but that’s done. now i am going to sit with the idea, the emotion, the pain. learn and experience, because who knows when the next period of calm will happen again?
