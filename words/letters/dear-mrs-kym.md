Dear Mrs Kym
You know what really sucks about this whole roommate thing? I no longer get any time alone, I miss my me time, I miss my Mia, I miss my sisters, I even miss my mom. 
Jess says she is going home one of this weekends and that I can come with her, and I do wanna go home but I am scared at the same time.  Does that make any sense to you? Cuz it doesn’t make any to me, and it is driving me crazy.  I just cannot take it anymore. But I don’t know what to do with myself. 
All I keep thinking about is a girlfriend, but that makes me feel like crap cuz I know that being gay is wrong, it’s a sin.  My mind is in a fog and confusion of time, one second it’s the greatest thing in the world, the idea of being with “her” forever, the next I am burning in hell for lust and fornication.  My friend, who is lesbian, just told me she asked her girl to marry her, so they are going to live in a place where it is legal.  Before she told me that, like months before I wrote this poem for her, but I never gave it to her:

	
	which is really more important?
	
	I wanted to ask her, “I have you ever wondered: what if there is a god and what the bible says is true?  is it really worth it?”  
	I mean, how can you live, live a life you think is happy, were you want to be, with her, knowing in the back of your head, always wondering if you are gonna burn.  
	thinking that somewhere there is god, almighty, all-powerful, and at times vengeful, watching and hating your life style, your love  
	I started to ask, “is it really worth it?  laying with her?  holding her hand?  running your fingers through her hair?”  
	you can forget that sometimes you have doubts, being with her, and being better than her last.  
	and when she smiles and looks into your eyes nothing else matters but that which is melting you, because somewhere, little deeper than that thought of god, you know she is the reason why you live.  
	I asked nothing.  she talked about her sweetheart, I believe her name is Janelle, their home, theirs jobs, their love, and her new-found happiness.  
	soon enough my love life, of lack there of, became the topic of conversion.  
	you were telling me about a crush?  what came of it?  did you tell her?  have you chose an out?  what are you waiting for?  
	and I say little, enough to keep her back…yes, nothing, no, not yet… I have not decided  
	
	I should have asked, “can you really live believing in both?"
	

I have yet to send it to her, I am scared she will tell me it is worth it.
No matter what I do, I am the good girl, not matter how I try to fuck up or be mean, the only things I can really mess up are the things I need to go right, like friendships and school.  I think that if for once I just really didn’t acre things would be a lot easier for me.  

I am sure you really don’t wanna be reading this and I am not why I am sending this to you.  Maybe I just validation that I do have thoughts and that they can be serious. Everybody thinks I am fucking joke, cuz I laugh a lot and others usually are laughing either at me or with me, sometimes I really cant tell.
I started going to this black Deaf club on campus, it is pretty cool, but I am learning that after Carrick and after Pitt, I have no idea how to behave around black people any more.  Or at least that is how I feel.  Some how I have made friends with half the pot heads in my building, and all the smokers, of cigarettes, and I feel like I am meeting the wrong type of people, but it so much easier to be me if I don’t care what the people around think about me.  I care what women think about me, I care what black people think about me and I so wish that I didn’t so I could just be myself ... which I guess would be easier if I thought I knew who I was, but that’s another story that I don’t feel like getting into, so I wont,
But I miss being able to talk to you, even if I still did end up writing all the important stuff down. One time Mia said to me something like I wish you couldn’t write, then you would have to talk to me, I told no, you just wont know anything about me. And sometimes I really think that is true.
But I am gonna go no cuz it is like 2 o’clock in the morning and I have to be at work at 9.
