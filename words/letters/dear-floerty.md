# Dear Floetry `MySpace Message`
## Subject: Your Music

I came across your first CD by mistake, I thought y'all were someone else. But I most say, that was one of the best mistakes I ever made. I have listened to that CD so many times, I am surprised that it still plays like new. 

If i had to pick one song off it to say was my favorite, it would be _If I was a Bird_. My iTunes says that songs has been played more than 200 times. One day, it was playing in the background all day, it was the only song I listened to. I can't say why, but something about that song just fell into me, like there was a hole waiting to be filled with it. I am sure that the fact I love rain has something to do with it. But the next day (after my day of that song only) I wrote a poem called "sometimes I fly away" and I thought I should share it, since I can, with the women who made it happen. 

so here it goes: 

#### sometimes I fly away (by Dia Allen) 
& other times I couple with self-pity  
whose glasses are despair-colored & free  
& walk aimlessly through reality 

I have moved about with a witty  
passion, filled with a strange glee  
& other times I couple with self-pity 

I have heard from the committee  
their warning are useless, so i flee  
& walk aimlessly through reality 

sometimes i search for my inner city  
aware that that knowledge is key  
& other times I couple with self-pity 

if i was a bird, & could fly high & pretty  
I'd have no need to make such a plea  
& walk aimlessly through reality 

sometimes i float around this city  
lifted by the idea of being me  
& other times I couple with self-pity  
& walk aimlessly through reality 


i hope you enjoyed the poem  
have a great day  

Dia  
by the way, yes, i do feel clever
