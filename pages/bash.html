<div class="sect">Music Clean Up</div>
<p>So this script was created because a friend gave me a bunch of music and I wanted a way to go through it. I wanted an easy way to listen to the song and (once I decided if I was going to keep it or not) have it be moved to a "keep" or "trash" folder.<br/>And as you'll see at the top of the script, I got ideas and knowledge from quite a few different places.</p>


<div class="sect">Make Music Pretty</div>
<p>This is a bash script I created using a few programs to update and complete the meta data/tags on my mp3 files. I like it when iTunes has an ablum cover for every song</p>

<div class="sect">Post to Tumblr</div>
<p>I enjoy working form the command line and made this script for posting stories and links to one of my Tumblr blogs. It uses {insert program name}.</p>
